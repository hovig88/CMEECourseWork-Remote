# Week 3: CMEE Bootcamp: Biological Computing in R

* The third week was an introduction to the R programming language. It covered from performing simple operations, writing scripts and functions, data management, and data visualization.

* The **Week3** directory includes the following subdirectories: *code*, *data*, *results*, and *sandbox*.
    - code - includes all the Week 3 practicals/assignments and in-class scripts
    - data - includes the data needed as inputs for some of the scripts/commands
    - results - essentially an empty directory, but includes a .gitignore file (since completely empty directories cannnot be pushed to git)
    - sandbox - similar to a recycle bin; disposing files that are not needed for assessment, but might still be useful for the author if and when needed
