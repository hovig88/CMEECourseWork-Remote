# Week 1: Course Induction & CMEE Bootcamp Intro

* The first week was an induction to the CMEE Masters course and an introduction to the Unix environment, shell scripting, version control with git, and typesetting with LaTeX.

* The **Week1** directory includes a .gitignore file and the following subdirectories: *Code*, *Data*, *Results*, and *Sandbox*.
    - Code - includes all the scripts and commands related to the Week 1 practicals/assignments.
    - Data - includes the data needed as inputs for some of the scripts/commands.
    - Results - essentially an empty directory, but includes an empty `.keep` file (since completely empty directories cannnot be pushed to git).
    - Sandbox - similar to a recycle bin; disposing files that are not needed for assessment, but might still be useful for the author if and when needed.
