# Week 6: Genomics and Bioinformatics

* The sixth week introduced the type of questions that can be addressed with genomic data, and the methodologies that are available for answering these questions. Learning was accomplished through a mix of lectures, computer practicals, and group discussions.

* The **Week6** directory includes the following subdirectories: *code*, *data*, *results*, and *sandbox*.
    - code - includes all the Week 6 practicals
    - data - includes the data needed as inputs for the practicals
    - results - essentially an empty directory, but includes a .gitignore file (since completely empty directories cannnot be pushed to git)
    - sandbox - similar to a recycle bin; disposing files that are not needed for assessment, but might still be useful for the author if and when needed
