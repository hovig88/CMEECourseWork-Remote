# Week 9: High Performance Computing

* The ninth week  introduced the tools and techniques of high performance computing for biological problems using R.

* The **Week9** directory includes the following subdirectories: *code*, *data*, *results*, and *sandbox*.
    - code - includes all the Week 9 practicals
    - data - includes `lectures` directory, which contains lecture slides
    - results - essentially an empty directory, but includes a .gitignore file (since completely empty directories cannnot be pushed to git)
    - sandbox - similar to a recycle bin; disposing files that are not needed for assessment, but might still be useful for the author if and when needed
