# Week 7: Biological Computing in Python II

* The seventh week  was a continuation to the Intro Python Week. The overall aims,format, and venue of the lectures and practicals were the same as that Python-focused Bootcamp week.

* The **Week7** directory includes the following subdirectories: *code*, *data*, *results*, and *sandbox*.
    - code - includes all the Week 7 practicals/assignments and in-class scripts
    - data - includes the data needed as inputs for some of the scripts/commands
    - results - essentially an empty directory, but includes a .gitignore file (since completely empty directories cannnot be pushed to git)
    - sandbox - similar to a recycle bin; disposing files that are not needed for assessment, but might still be useful for the author if and when needed

## Contents

* profileme.py - Some functions to explain the concept of profiling in Python
* timeitme.py - Comparing run time for using loops vs list comprehensions and loops vs the join method utilizing the timeit module
