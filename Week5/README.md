# Week 5: Spatial Analyses and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

* The fifth week was focused on using and handling GIS data, along with basic remote sensing to generate GIS data and the use of GIS data in a range of applications using R.

* The **Week5** directory includes the following subdirectories: *code*, *data*, *results*, and *sandbox*.
    - code - includes all the Week 5 practicals
    - data - includes the data needed as inputs for the practicals
    - results - essentially an empty directory, but includes a .gitignore file (since completely empty directories cannnot be pushed to git)
    - sandbox - similar to a recycle bin; disposing files that are not needed for assessment, but might still be useful for the author if and when needed
