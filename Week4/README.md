# Week 4: Statistics in R

* The fourth week was focused on a core set of statistical methods that are of wide use in research projects.

* The **Week4** directory includes the following subdirectories: *code*, *data*, *results*, and *sandbox*.
    - code - includes all the Week 4 practicals
    - data - includes two subdirectories `HandoutsandData` and `Lectures`, which contain handouts and data used in the practicals and lecture slides, respectively
    - results - essentially an empty directory, but includes a .gitignore file (since completely empty directories cannnot be pushed to git)
    - sandbox - similar to a recycle bin; disposing files that are not needed for assessment, but might still be useful for the author if and when needed
