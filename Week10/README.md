# Week 10: Biological Data Structures and C

* The tenth week introduced basics of procedural programming in C and applications related to biological data structures such as (phylogenetic) trees and other networks.

* The **Week10** directory includes the following subdirectories: *code*, *data*, *results*, and *sandbox*.
    - code - includes all the Week 10 in-class scripts
    - data - empty; can include data needed for some C scripts
    - results - essentially an empty directory, but includes a .gitignore file (since completely empty directories cannnot be pushed to git)
    - sandbox - similar to a recycle bin; disposing files that are not needed for assessment, but might still be useful for the author if and when needed
