# MiniProject (Week 8): Miniproject: Hackathon

* The eight week focused on the miniproject assignment in a hackathon format.

* The **MiniProject** directory includes the following subdirectories: *code*, *data*, *results*, and *sandbox*.
    - code - includes scripts needed for the miniproject
    - data - includes data needed for some of the scripts/commands
    - results - essentially an empty directory, but includes a .gitignore file (since completely empty directories cannnot be pushed to git)
    - sandbox - similar to a recycle bin; disposing files that are not needed for assessment, but might still be useful for the author if and when needed
